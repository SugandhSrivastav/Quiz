# ðŸ§© Microservices Concept Project

This GitHub repository is a demonstration of core **Microservices Architecture** concepts using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud** components. It includes the following key modules:

**Reference:** For detailed revesion of Concepts please visit **CodeWithDurgesh Microservices CrashCourse**(https://youtu.be/Nb2PPuqtL2g)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and Concepts

- **Feign Client** â€“ Used for declarative REST client communication between microservices.
- **API Gateway** â€“ Acts as a single entry point into the system, handling routing and filtering of requests.
- **Eureka Server** â€“ A service registry that enables service discovery.
- **Eureka Client** â€“ Registers individual microservices with the Eureka Server for discovery by other services.

## ðŸ“š Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a hands-on understanding of how to:

- Build and register microservices with Eureka.
- Use Feign for inter-service communication.
- Route requests through an API Gateway.
- Understand service discovery and centralized entry points in a microservices architecture.
